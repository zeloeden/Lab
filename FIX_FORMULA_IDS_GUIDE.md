## One-Click Solution

---

## ✅ **I've Added a Fix Button for You!**

You don't need to run any console commands - I've added a **"Fix Formula IDs"** button in the Settings page!

---

## 🚀 **How to Fix Your Formula**

### **Step 1: Go to Settings**
```
1. Open the application
2. Click "Settings" in the sidebar
3. Scroll down to the "Developer" tab
4. Click the "Developer" tab
```

### **Step 2: Click "Fix Formula IDs"**
```
You'll see three buttons:
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Seed Test Data] [Clear All Data]  │
│  [Fix Formula IDs]                   │  ← Click this one!
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Step 3: Wait for Success**
```
You'll see a toast notification:
"🔧 Fixed 1 formula ingredient(s)!"

The page will automatically reload after 2 seconds.
```

### **Step 4: Try the Preparation Again**
```
1. Go to Formulas page
2. Start the "sky" preparation
3. Scan the Musk AL Tahara QR code
4. ✅ It should work now!
```

---

## 🔍 **What the Button Does**

The button automatically:
1. ✅ Checks all formulas for broken ingredient IDs
2. ✅ Finds the correct sample by matching the code (e.g., `GIV001001`)
3. ✅ Updates the formula to use the current sample ID
4. ✅ Saves the fixed formula
5. ✅ Reloads the page

**No manual work needed!** 🎉

---

## 📊 **How to Know It Worked**

After clicking the button, check the console (F12):

```
Formula Fix Results:
✅ Fixed "sky" ingredient 1 (code: GIV001001)
```

If you see this, the formula is fixed!

## 🎯 **Two Options (Choose One)**

### **Option 1: Fix Formula IDs** (Recommended)
- ✅ Keeps all your existing data
- ✅ Only fixes the broken references
- ✅ Quick and safe
- 👉 **Use the "Fix Formula IDs" button**

### **Option 2: Clear All Data**
- ⚠️ Deletes EVERYTHING
- ⚠️ Starts fresh with seed data
- ⚠️ You'll lose your custom samples/formulas
- 👉 **Use the "Clear All Data" button** (only if you want to start over)

---

## 🧪 **After the Fix**

Test that it worked:

```
1. Go to Formulas page
2. Start "sky" preparation
3. At Step 1, scan or type: GIV001001
4. Expected result:
   ✅ Code input turns GREEN
   ✅ "Wrong code" disappears
   ✅ Console shows: [CodeInput] Registry match result: true
   ✅ Can proceed to weighing
```

---

## 💡 **Why This Happened**

- You edited/saved the "Musk AL Tahara" sample
- This generated a new sample ID
- The formula still referenced the old ID
- The fix button updates the formula to use the new ID

**This is now fixed with ONE CLICK!** 🚀
