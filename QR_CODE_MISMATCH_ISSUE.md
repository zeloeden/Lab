# QR Code Data Mismatch - Critical Issue Found
## October 20, 2025

## 🚨 **Critical Issue Discovered**

Your QR code has **WRONG DATA** - the code and name don't match!

### **The Problem:**

**Your QR Code Says:**
```
CODE=EXP001001        ← This is "Plat"
NAME=MUSKALTAHARA     ← This is "Musk AL Tahara"
```

**These don't match!** `EXP001001` should be "Plat", not "Musk AL Tahara"!

---

## 🔍 **Evidence from Console:**

### **What the Formula Expects (Step 1):**
```javascript
Step 1: "Musk AL Tahara"
validCodes: [
  'RM:sample-EXP001001',  // ← Wait, this is wrong!
  'S:EXP001001',          // ← This is Plat's code!
  'EXP001001'             // ← This should be GIV001001!
]
```

### **What the Formula Expects (Step 2):**
```javascript
Step 2: "Plat"
validCodes: [
  'RM:sample-GIV001001',  // ← Wait, this is wrong too!
  'S:GIV001001',          // ← This is Musk's code!
  'GIV001001'             // ← This should be EXP001001!
]
```

**The codes are SWAPPED!**

---

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

When you re-saved the samples, somehow the **codes got mixed up**:
- "Musk AL Tahara" sample has code `EXP001001` (should be `GIV001001`)
- "Plat" sample has code `GIV001001` (should be `EXP001001`)

This is why scanning doesn't work - the QR codes have the wrong data!

## ✅ **Solution: Clear All Data and Reseed**

This will fix EVERYTHING by creating fresh samples with correct codes:

### **Step 1: Clear All Data**
```
1. Go to Settings
2. Click Developer tab
3. Click "Clear All Data" (red button)
4. Confirm
```

### **Step 2: Seed Test Data**
```
1. Click "Seed Test Data" (blue button)
2. Confirm
3. Wait for page reload
```

### **What You'll Get:**
```
✅ Musk AL Tahara with code GIV001001 (correct!)
✅ Plat with code EXP001001 (correct!)
✅ Formulas that reference the right samples
✅ QR codes with matching data
✅ Everything works perfectly!
```

---

## 🧪 **After Reseed - Test:**

```
1. Go to Formulas
2. Start "sky" preparation
3. Step 1 should be "Musk AL Tahara"
4. Scan or type: GIV001001
5. ✅ Should work!
```

## 📊 **Comparison:**

### **Current State (BROKEN):**
```
Sample: "Musk AL Tahara"
Code in DB: EXP001001  ← WRONG!
QR contains: CODE=EXP001001, NAME=MUSKALTAHARA
Formula expects: codes with EXP001001
Scan result: ❌ Mismatch!
```

### **After Reseed (FIXED):**
```
Sample: "Musk AL Tahara"
Code in DB: GIV001001  ← CORRECT!
QR contains: CODE=GIV001001, NAME=MUSKALTAHARA
Formula expects: codes with GIV001001
Scan result: ✅ Match!
```

## 💡 **Why "Fix Formula IDs" Button Won't Work**

The problem isn't just mismatched IDs - the **sample data itself is wrong**. The codes are swapped between samples. No amount of ID fixing will help because the actual data is corrupted.

**You MUST reseed to get correct sample data.**

---

## ⚡ **Do This Now:**

1. **Settings** → **Developer** → **Clear All Data**
2. **Settings** → **Developer** → **Seed Test Data**
3. **Refresh** the page
4. **Test** scanning again

**This is the ONLY way to fix the swapped codes issue!**
