# Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Running the App with Scale Bridge

### Option 1: Combined Dev Script (Recommended)
Start both Vite dev server and scale bridge together:

```bash
pnpm run dev:with-bridge
```

**What it does:**
- Starts Vite on port 5173 (opens browser automatically)
- Starts scale bridge on ws://127.0.0.1:8787
- Shows colored output: cyan for vite, magenta for bridge
- Stops both when you press Ctrl+C

### Option 2: Resilient Runner (Production-like)
Uses the auto-restart bridge runner:

```bash
pnpm run dev:with-bridge:runner
```

**What it does:**
- Starts resilient bridge runner (auto-restarts on crash)
- Starts Vite with mount verification
- Green output for bridge, blue for web

### Option 3: Separate Processes
Run in separate terminals for more control:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start bridge
pnpm run scale:bridge:auto

# Terminal 2: Start app
pnpm run dev
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scale Bridge Configuration

### In the App (Settings)
1. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Scale Settings**
2. Select **Mode: Local Bridge (WS)**
3. Set **Bridge URL:** `ws://127.0.0.1:8787`
4. Click **Ping** to test connection
5. Status should show üü¢ **Connected**

### Bridge Modes

| Script | Mode | Polling | Best For |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `scale:bridge:auto` | Soft (P) | 500ms | Development (default) |
| `scale:bridge:soft` | Soft (P) | 500ms | COM3 specific |
| `scale:bridge:cont` | Continuous | 1000ms | Production |
| `bridge:start` | Auto-restart | 500ms | Production (resilient) |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port 8787 Already in Use (EADDRINUSE)

**Option 1: Kill existing Node processes (Windows)**
```powershell
taskkill /IM node.exe /F
```

**Option 2: Use different port**
```bash
# Set WS_PORT environment variable
cross-env JA_WS_PORT=8790 pnpm run scale:bridge:auto
```

Then update Settings ‚Üí Bridge URL to `ws://127.0.0.1:8790`

**Option 3: Let bridge auto-increment**
The bridge will automatically try ports 8787, 8788, 8789... (up to 10 attempts)
Check the console output to see which port it bound to.

### Bridge Won't Start

1. **Check Node.js version:**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be v18+
   ```

2. **Check COM port:**
   - Open Device Manager ‚Üí Ports (COM & LPT)
   - Note the COM port number (e.g., COM3, COM4)
   - Update script if needed: `JA_PORT=COM4`

3. **Check bridge logs:**
   ```bash
   # Run bridge directly to see errors
   node scripts/ja5003_ws_bridge.js
   ```

4. **Try AUTO port detection:**
   ```bash
   cross-env JA_PORT=AUTO pnpm run scale:bridge:auto
   ```

### Scale Not Detected (AUTO mode)

1. Verify scale is connected and powered on
2. Check USB cable
3. Try specific port instead of AUTO:
   ```bash
   cross-env JA_PORT=COM3 pnpm run scale:bridge:auto
   ```

### Bridge Crashes Repeatedly

1. Check Node.js version (v18+ required)
2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Check serial port permissions (Linux/Mac)
4. Use resilient runner:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:with-bridge:runner
   ```

## üìä Diagnostics

### Check System Status
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/__diag`

**What to check:**
- ‚úÖ Network: Online
- ‚úÖ Database (Dexie): Connected
- ‚úÖ Scale WS Bridge: üü¢ Connected
- ‚úÖ Bridge URL: ws://127.0.0.1:8787
- ‚úÖ Last packet: < 5s ago

### Bridge Status Badges

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| üü¢ Green | Connected, receiving fresh data (< 5s) |
| üü° Amber | Connected, but data is stale (‚â• 5s) |
| üî¥ Red | Disconnected |

### Console Logs

**Bridge logs show:**
```
[debug] Available ports: [ 'COM3', 'COM4' ]
[serial] OPENED COM3
‚úì JA5003 WS Bridge on ws://127.0.0.1:8787
```

**Vite logs show:**
```
VITE v5.4.20  ready in 342 ms
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

## üéØ Common Workflows

### Development (No Scale)
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
Just run the app. Settings will show bridge disconnected (expected).

### Development (With Scale)
```bash
pnpm run dev:with-bridge
```
Starts both app and bridge. Scale readings appear in real-time.

### Testing E2E (With Mock Scale)
```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```
Uses mock scale server on port 9878 (automatic).

### Production (Windows Service)
```bash
# Install service (one time)
pnpm run scale:install-bridge

# Start service
nssm start JA5003Bridge

# Run app
pnpm run dev
```
Bridge runs as background service, survives reboots.

## üéâ Tips

1. **First time setup?** Use `dev:with-bridge` - it's the easiest
2. **Bridge keeps crashing?** Use `dev:with-bridge:runner` for auto-restart
3. **Testing without hardware?** Just run `pnpm run dev` and ignore bridge warnings
4. **Production deployment?** Install as Windows Service (see `docs/BRIDGE_SERVICE_INSTALLATION.md`)
5. **Port conflicts?** The bridge auto-increments, just check console for actual port
